# iostvoyHM-archive

iostvoyHM (also known as efport or ioEF) is a fork of ioquake3 for running _Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force Holomatch_ (multiplayer). It was created by [Thilo Schulz](https://github.com/thiloschulz). This is an archive of iostvoyHM patches. For playing Elite Force zturtleman would recommend his [Lilium Voyager](https://clover.moe/lilium-voyager) fork.

In the `patches` directory you can find the original iostvoyHM source code `.diff` patches that can be applied to [ioquake3 svn repository](https://svn.icculus.org/quake3). The ioquake3 svn revision number is included in the patch file name. The patches use to be hosted at [http://thilo.kickchat.com/efport-progress/patches/](https://web.archive.org/web/20180422050624/http://thilo.kickchat.com/efport-progress/patches/) (link to archive.org).

In this git repo there are branches with the iostvoyHM patches applied to [ioquake3 git repository](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3) (using the same history as the ioquake3 git repository) and possibly some additional changes to fix or simplify compiling.

## Missing patches

The older patches are were not completely backed up by archive.org (about half of the patch is missing). They are included in the `incomplete-patches-from-archive.org` directory though they are probably not very useful.

## Newer builds

Thilo Schulz updated it to ioquake3 git in 2016, see [thiloschulz/ioef](https://github.com/thiloschulz/ioef) repo.
